_Larmor's Aperiodic Flows_

I'm wondering if you're familiar with the [paper](/literature/Wildroe-1928.pdf) attached. 

It's author is Rolf Wider√∏e. You probably already know who he is, but he is the man credited with some of the original concepts of particle acceleration.

The PDF paper I've attached is written in German, I've also attached an AI translated version (the Microsoft Word Document) but the translator didn't do a very good job, so I wanted to include the original as well.

As always, I may be misinterpreting the paper, but it seems as though the author is describing a type of ion accelerator, using electrodynamic, vortex acceleration for the beam. The beam is then used as the secondary coil of a voltage transformer. The author concludes that it would be possible to attain incredibly high voltages in this manner using very little machinery. 

I think a tesla coil is used to create a rectified, pulsed DC current with a hollow metal tube acting as an electrode under a constantly changing electric field. The changing electric field in the tube accelerates ions as they pass through it using vortex mechanics (induced by the high frequency pulsed DC field).

So this may be analogous to slapping a tether ball around a pole if you get what I'm saying. Surprisingly, no modern acceleration techniques seem to operate off of this principle. The first thing that popped into my head after seeing this paper was your paper, "Power transfer in velocity-vortex acceleration." 

this electron beam, accelerated by vortex forces of pulsed DC electric fields, is then used as the "secondary coil" of a voltage transformer.

Could a dense, vortex accelerated electron beam act as one of the coils of either the 2-coil or 4-coil configurations of the magnetic resonant circuits that you describe within your paper and book? I have a feeling that the lack of metal conductor has a significant effect on the character of the magnetic projection field "H" that you describe within your work, but I don't know exactly how. 

Beyond that, I don't necessarily understand principles at play here. I feel like the author might be trying to describe the Larmor Precession at some point in this paper. I decided to also attach a letter sent from Professor Feynman to Kenneth Shoulders that seems to describe another concept for vortex electron acceleration. 

All of this seems related to me, was just curious if you've heard of any of these things and if you have thoughts on them?
